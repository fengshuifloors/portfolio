        <p>Last year, after the pandemic hit. I decided to buy a pontoon boat.
        I made this site to show some of the things I did over the summer. There are links above to some
        of the pics I took during the the past year. I moved here about two years
        ago, and live about 10 minutes from the bay, and 20 minutes from the beach. I go fishing a good bit. On the
        bay, I fish for flounder and blue's. On the beach, I fish for striper's and rockfish.
         That brings us to the crabs. The season starts around the end of June until the middle
        of October. Unfortunatly that means right now. I usualy catch about two or
        three bushells every week. I have to give alot to the neighbors, because there's so many.</p><p>
        When I'm not on the boat fishing or crabbing, I'll go out and ride my e-bike. There are around 500
        trails around here, so there  might be alot of pics. I was never real interested in bikes before, but
        once I rode an e-bike. I had to get one of them. I go about 30 miles on a charge, so it lasts prety much
        all day. It's half bicycle, half motorcycle, and does about 23mph. When you go on the smaller trails,
        it can get a little
        scetchy. You can only do about 5mph, but I've only layed it down  about 2 or 3 times. Don't wory I'm
        OK.</p>
                <p>Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and
        the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the
        level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed
        to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking
        down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.
